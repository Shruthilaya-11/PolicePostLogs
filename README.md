SecureCheck: A Python-SQL Digital Ledger for Police Post Logs
It is a web-based dashboard built using Python, Streamlit, and MySQL that allows users to visualize and analyze police traffic stop data. The app automatically loads data from a CSV file into a MySQL database if the table is empty. Once loaded, users can interact with the data through filters based on stop date, driver gender, and violation type. The dashboard displays key metrics like total arrests and drug-related stops, as well as bar graphs for violation frequencies. Users can also run predefined SQL queries categorized into medium and complex levels to explore insights based on vehicles, driver demographics, time, violations, and locations. Additionally, the app includes a form that allows users to simulate a new police stop by entering key details and receive a prediction for the likely stop outcome and violation based on historical patterns. The project is intended as a data exploration tool and a simple demonstration of combining Python, SQL, and Streamlit for interactive dashboards.
